This project implements a dynamic food web simulation written in C, designed to model predator-prey relationships using manually managed heap-allocated data structures. The application allows users to construct,
modify, and analyze an ecosystem through a command-line interface.

How to run the project:

Step #1 (Compile the Program):

gcc main.c -o main

Step #2 (Run the Program):

./main  


Program walkthrough (with screenshots):

The user is prompted to enter the names of organisms one at a time to construct the initial food web, continuing until they type DONE to signal completion.
